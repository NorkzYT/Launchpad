# How to get more FreeForever Oracle Cloud Accounts

## Introduction

To create an Oracle Cloud Account, you need to provide a unique email address, password, home address, phone number, and credit or debit card. The credit or debit card will be used for verification purposes, and the information provided will not be retained after the account is created. To ensure the account is unique, Oracle checks for unique IP addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses. It is also possible to create an Oracle Cloud Account using a phone connected to a service provider such as At&t, Cricket, or Verizon.

## Steps during and after Login

Avoid using any "`AD-Blockers`" for the Oracle Cloud Account during, and after [logging in](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html) to the Oracle Cloud Account.

Follow the steps at the beginning of this guide from https://docs.ibracorp.io/vaultwarden-on-oracle-cloud-vps.

## Requirements

To create a new Oracle Cloud account, you need to use a unique IP address, email address, phone number, home address, and credit or debit card. If you have already created an Oracle Cloud account and want to create a new one, you will need to use different information for these fields. You can use a domain catchall email address, such as time@domain1.com, as the email address for the new account. After the account is created, you can modify the additional information provided during the account creation process from the account settings page such as the email address.


In a numbered list format:

1.  Unique IP                   - Recommended: **TURN OFF Wifi**, and use connection of service provider such as At&t, Cricket, or Verizon. Second option: Different IP's can be used as well.
2.  Unique Email address        - Recommended: This can be a domain catchall email such as time@domain1.com.
3.  Unique Phone Number         - Phone number that is verifiable by text message.
4.  Unique Home Address         - Same address as what is listed in the Credit/Debit card.
5.  Unique Credit/Debit card    - Virtual Credit Cards do not work. Use a real card.
