## Contribution Guide

Fork the Repository: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

Clone the Repository: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to work on it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NorkzYT/Launchpad.git
```

Create a New Branch: Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the work isolated and makes it easy to later merge your changes back into the main repository.
```bash
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

Make Your Changes: Implement your changes in the new branch. Be sure to commit in logical chunks and provide clear and descriptive commit messages.

Push Your Changes: After making your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub.
```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```
Create a Pull Request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button. Ensure you're comparing the branch on your fork to the master branch on the original repository.

Describe Your Changes: In the pull request description, explain your changes, why you made them, and any testing you did. The more information the better!

Wait for Review: Now your changes are ready for review! I will review your changes as soon as I can. If I have any questions or request changes, I will communicate through the pull request.

Remember, contributions are not just about code - any resources, documentation, or tools that help the community are valuable. Thank you for your contribution!
